# Expanded box dimensions:
- decision nodes: text width 2cm → 2.2cm
- result boxes: text width 2.8cm → 3.4cm  
- result box height: 1cm → 1.3cm
- action boxes: 2.5cm → 2.8cm width
# Added explicit font sizing:
- decision/.style: added font=\small
- action/.style: added font=\small
- result/.style: added font=\small
# Abbreviated long labels:
- "High quality needed?" → "Quality needed?"
- "Explainability?" → "Explain?"
- "Active Learning" → "Active Learn"
```

**Impact:**

### Fix 1.3: Timeline Milestone Overlap ✅
**Problem:** Adjacent milestone boxes too close, creating visual clutter

**Changes Made:**
```latex
# Staggered vertical positions for better separation:
- GroupLens: (1.5, 2.5) → (1.5, 2.6) [slight up]
- Content-Based: (3, 1.5) → (3, 1.4) [slight down]
- Netflix Prize: (4.5, 2.8) → (4.5, 3.0) [up]
- Hu et al.: (5.5, 1.8) → (5.5, 2.0) [up]
- Neural CF: (8.5, 2.5) → (8.5, 2.6) [slight up]
- Attention: (9.5, 1.5) → (9.5, 1.4) [slight down]
# Pattern: 3.0, 2.6, 2.2, 2.0, 1.4, 0.8 (clearer vertical spacing)
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ Milestones no longer overlap
- ✅ Clearer timeline progression
- ✅ Easier to read individual milestones
- ✅ More professional appearance

**File:** `sections/challenges_future.tex` (lines 77-283)

---

### Fix 2.2: Survey Limitations Section ✅
**Problem:** No critical self-reflection on survey methodology (expected in rigorous surveys)

**What Was Added:**
Comprehensive 3-page "Survey Limitations and Methodological Constraints" section:

#### 2.2.1 Paper Selection and Coverage Biases
- **Temporal Bias:** Emphasis on recent work (2015-2025) vs. foundational methods
- **Venue Bias:** Top-tier academic venues, missing industry technical reports
- **Language Bias:** English-only, missing Chinese, Japanese, Korean research
- **Domain Coverage Gaps:** Listed 5 underrepresented domains (healthcare, education, IoT, finance, scientific literature)

#### 2.2.2 Methodological Limitations
- **Meta-Analysis Statistical Rigor:**
  - No confidence intervals
  - Heterogeneity not quantified (no I² statistic)
  - Publication bias not assessed (no funnel plots)
  - Simple mean aggregation vs. weighted meta-analysis
  - Inconsistent baselines across studies
  
- **Systematic Review Protocol:**
  - No pre-registered protocol
  - No PRISMA flow diagram
  - Single reviewer (no independent screening)
  - No formal quality assessment
  - No risk of bias assessment

- **Search Strategy Transparency:**
  - Exact search queries not documented
  - Date ranges not specified precisely
  - Inclusion/exclusion criteria lack examples
  - Grey literature procedures not described

#### 2.2.3 Conceptual and Framing Limitations
- Binary taxonomy oversimplifies continuum
- Context independence (what works for music ≠ enterprise software)
- Technical focus (less coverage of UX, business models, organizational challenges)

#### 2.2.4 Reproducibility and Artifact Limitations
- No released artifacts (code, curated bibliography, datasets, tools)
- Snapshot nature (rapid field evolution)
- Recent papers not thoroughly evaluated by community

#### 2.2.5 Implications and Future Work
**7 concrete recommendations:**
1. Living survey approach (continuously updated)
2. Collaborative community effort
3. Multilingual inclusion
4. Industry partnerships
5. Formal meta-analysis with statistics
6. Artifact release
7. User-centric complementary surveys

**Transparency Statement:**
"We acknowledge these limitations openly to help readers critically evaluate our contributions and identify opportunities for complementary research."

**Impact:**
- ✅ Demonstrates scholarly integrity
- ✅ Helps readers interpret findings appropriately
- ✅ Identifies opportunities for future work
- ✅ Sets standard for transparent survey methodology
- ✅ Addresses reviewer concerns about rigor

**Word Count:** ~1,800 words  
**File:** `sections/challenges_future.tex` (new section at end before conclusion)

### Fix 2.3: Nuanced Trade-off Claims in Abstract ✅
**Problem:** Oversimplified "implicit=noisy, explicit=precise" claims

**Before:**
> "Our framework reveals fundamental trade-offs between feedback types: implicit feedback provides abundant but noisy signals enabling real-time adaptation, while explicit feedback offers precise but sparse data requiring sophisticated bias handling."

**After:**
> "Our empirical meta-analysis of 45 studies reveals that hybrid approaches combining both feedback types typically achieve 15-32% performance improvements over pure methods, demonstrating their complementary nature. While implicit feedback often provides abundant signals enabling real-time adaptation, its quality varies significantly by context—purchases indicate strong preference while clicks may reflect curiosity or accident. Conversely, explicit feedback typically offers higher precision in controlled settings, yet remains vulnerable to strategic behavior, rating inflation, and severe sparsity in practice."

**Key Improvements:**
- ✅ Leads with concrete empirical finding (15-32% improvement)
- ✅ Adds nuance: "often" vs. absolute claims
- ✅ Context-dependent: "purchases ≠ clicks" (implicit not uniformly noisy)
- ✅ Acknowledges explicit feedback vulnerabilities (strategic behavior, inflation)
- ✅ "Typically" and "often" rather than absolute claims

**Additional Changes:**
- Shortened from 350 words to 280 words (more focused)
- Restructured contributions to highlight key findings first
- Added explicit mention: "no universal 'best' approach"
- Changed "bias-aware evaluation methodologies" to "privacy-preserving feedback collection" (clearer)

**Impact:**
- ✅ More scientifically accurate
- ✅ Prevents oversimplification criticism
- ✅ Shows sophisticated understanding
- ✅ More compelling with concrete numbers

**File:** `survey_paper.tex` (lines 51-64)
