# Page Orientation Verification Report

## ✅ CONFIRMED: Document is in PORTRAIT mode

### PDF Metadata Analysis
```
Page Size:     486 x 720 pts
Width:         486 pts (6.75 inches)
Height:        720 pts (10.0 inches)
Ratio:         1.48:1 (Height/Width)
Rotation:      0° (no rotation)
Orientation:   PORTRAIT ✅
```

### Mathematical Verification
```
Portrait Definition: Height > Width
Your Document:       720 > 486 ✅ TRUE

Therefore: Document IS portrait mode
```

### Standard Size Comparison
| Format | Width | Height | Ratio | Orientation |
|--------|-------|--------|-------|-------------|
| US Letter | 612 pts | 792 pts | 1.29:1 | Portrait |
| A4 | 595 pts | 842 pts | 1.41:1 | Portrait |
| **ACM Small (Yours)** | **486 pts** | **720 pts** | **1.48:1** | **Portrait ✅** |
| Landscape (Wrong) | 720 pts | 486 pts | 0.68:1 | Landscape ❌ |

### Why It Might APPEAR Landscape

The confusion likely comes from one or more of these factors:

#### 1. Two-Column Layout with Wide Figures
Your paper uses ACM's two-column format with **8 full-width figures** (using `figure*` environment):
- These figures span BOTH columns
- They appear wide relative to narrow text columns
- This is **STANDARD and CORRECT** for ACM papers
- Examples in your paper:
  - Feedback taxonomy tree (page ~12)
  - End-to-end architecture (page ~16)
  - Research landscape map (page ~6)
  - Bias impact matrix (page ~53)

#### 2. PDF Viewer Zoom/Fit Settings
Some PDF viewers:
- Auto-fit to window width
- Zoom to show two-column text clearly
- May make wide figures prominent
- Can give illusion of landscape orientation

**Solution:** Check your PDF viewer's "Page Display" or "View" settings:
- Ensure "Rotate Pages" is OFF
- Set to "Actual Size" or "Fit Height"
- Check "Document Properties" shows 486x720

#### 3. ACM Small Format
The `acmsmall` document class creates:
- Compact page size (smaller than US Letter or A4)
- Narrow columns (to maintain readability)
- Relatively wider-looking figures
- This is **intentional and correct** for ACM publications

### Verification Methods

#### Method 1: Direct Measurement
```bash
pdfinfo survey_paper.pdf | grep "Page size"
# Output: Page size: 486 x 720 pts
# First number (486) is WIDTH
# Second number (720) is HEIGHT
# Since 720 > 486, it's PORTRAIT ✅
```

#### Method 2: Visual Check
1. Open PDF in viewer
2. Go to File → Properties (or Ctrl+D)
3. Look at "Page Size"
4. Should show: 6.75" x 10" (portrait)

#### Method 3: Print Preview
1. File → Print Preview
2. Look at page thumbnail
3. Should appear as tall rectangle (portrait)
4. Not wide rectangle (landscape)

#### Method 4: Rotation Check
```bash
pdfinfo survey_paper.pdf | grep "Page rot"
# Output: Page rot: 0
# 0 = no rotation (correct)
# 90 or 270 = rotated (would be wrong)
```

### Document Class Settings

Your current settings are **CORRECT**:
```latex
\documentclass[acmsmall,screen]{acmart}
```

**Explanation:**
- `acmsmall` = ACM small format (two-column, compact)
- `screen` = Optimized for screen reading
- These create portrait pages with dimensions 486x720 pts

**Alternative formats** (if needed for different venues):
```latex
% These are other ACM formats (all portrait):
\documentclass[acmlarge]{acmart}      % Larger single-column
\documentclass[acmtog]{acmart}        % ACM TOG format
\documentclass[manuscript]{acmart}    % Manuscript format
```

All ACM formats are portrait by default. Landscape would require explicit `landscape` package.

### What IS Actually Wide (and that's OK)

#### Wide Figures (figure* environment)
Your paper contains these full-width elements:
1. Figure 1 - Feedback Framework (introduction)
2. Figure 2 - Evolution Timeline (related work)  
3. Figure 3 - Research Landscape (related work)
4. Figure 6 - System Architecture (methodology)
5. Figure 12 - Performance Comparison (evaluation)
6. Figure 13 - Bias Impact Matrix (challenges)
7. Table 2 - Metrics Taxonomy (evaluation)
8. Table 3 - Survey Comparison (related work)

**These are INTENTIONALLY wide** because:
- Complex visualizations need space
- Better readability than cramming into single column
- Standard practice in ACM publications
- Reviewers expect this format

### Conclusion

✅ **Your document IS in portrait mode**  
✅ **The orientation is CORRECT**  
✅ **No changes needed**

The wide appearance of some figures is:
- By design (figure* environment)
- Expected for ACM format
- Standard for complex visualizations
- Acceptable to publishers and reviewers

**Recommendation:** Keep the current settings. The document is properly formatted for ACM submission.

## Visual Proof

```
PORTRAIT (Current):          LANDSCAPE (Not your doc):
┌────────┐                   ┌─────────────────┐
