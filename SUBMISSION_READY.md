## What Was Fixed Today (Final Recheck Session)

### 🔴 CRITICAL BUG DISCOVERED & FIXED
**Problem:** Compilation was completely failing with error:
```
! Misplaced alignment tab character &.
```

**Location:** `sections/related_work.tex`, line 102

**Cause:** The "Wide&Deep" algorithm name in a TikZ node had an unescaped ampersand

**Fix:** Changed `{Wide\\&Deep}` to `{Wide\\\&Deep}` (escaped the &)

**Result:** ✅ Paper now compiles perfectly!
