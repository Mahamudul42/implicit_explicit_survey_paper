## 🎓 LESSONS LEARNED

### Importance of Final Recheck
The critical bug (unescaped &) was discovered only during this final systematic recheck. This demonstrates:
- **Always perform systematic verification** even when code "looks ready"
- **Compilation errors can hide** in complex LaTeX documents
- **Special character escaping** is critical in TikZ environments
- **Double compilation** catches cross-reference issues

### Best Practices Applied
1. ✅ Systematic error detection (grep patterns)
2. ✅ Precise error location identification
3. ✅ Root cause analysis (LaTeX special characters)
4. ✅ Targeted fix implementation
5. ✅ Comprehensive verification (double compilation)
6. ✅ Visual quality confirmation
