\begin{abstract}
Recommender systems have become integral to modern digital platforms, leveraging user feedback to personalize content and enhance user experience. This comprehensive survey provides an in-depth analysis of implicit and explicit feedback mechanisms in RS, highlighting their differences, modeling approaches, evaluation methodologies, and practical implications across diverse domains. Implicit feedback, derived from user behaviors such as clicks, views, and purchases, offers abundant data but introduces challenges like noise and sparsity. Explicit feedback, including ratings and reviews, provides clearer user preferences but suffers from low response rates and potential biases.

We present a detailed taxonomy of feedback types, encompassing sources, properties, and collection mechanisms, along with privacy considerations. The survey reviews learning paradigms from classical matrix factorization and collaborative filtering to advanced deep learning, reinforcement learning, and contrastive learning approaches. Hybrid models that integrate both feedback types are thoroughly examined. Evaluation methodologies are discussed, including standard metrics, biases in datasets, and user behavior interpretations. Applications across e-commerce, news, music, video streaming, and social media are explored, emphasizing how feedback types influence personalization and explainability.

Key challenges such as feedback sparsity, noise handling, user intent disambiguation, cold-start problems, and cross-domain learning are identified. Emerging directions, including feedback-aware fairness, contextual modeling, privacy-preserving techniques, and large language model-based feedback interpretation, are highlighted. A comparative analysis with detailed tables summarizes methods, datasets, metrics, and feedback types. The survey concludes with a visionary outlook on future RS that balance implicit and explicit feedback using self-supervised and multimodal approaches.

By synthesizing over a decade of research (2010--2025), this work aims to guide researchers and practitioners in developing more robust, fair, and interpretable recommender systems. The survey includes over 50 citations to seminal and recent works, providing a foundational reference for the field.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Recommender systems (RS) have evolved from simple collaborative filtering algorithms to sophisticated machine learning pipelines that power personalized experiences across digital platforms. These systems analyze user preferences to suggest relevant items, playing a pivotal role in e-commerce, entertainment, social media, and content platforms. The effectiveness of recommender systems fundamentally depends on the quality, quantity, and type of user feedback utilized for learning user preferences and item characteristics.

The landscape of user feedback in recommender systems is traditionally bifurcated into two primary categories: \textit{implicit feedback} and \textit{explicit feedback}. This dichotomy represents not just different data collection mechanisms, but fundamentally different approaches to understanding user preferences, each with distinct advantages, limitations, and modeling requirements.

\textbf{Implicit feedback} encompasses user behaviors that indirectly reveal preferences without requiring conscious effort from users. These signals include clicks, views, dwell times, purchases, shares, and other interaction patterns automatically captured by digital systems. The abundance of implicit feedback makes it particularly attractive for large-scale applications, but its inherent ambiguity and noise present significant modeling challenges.

\textbf{Explicit feedback}, in contrast, involves direct, intentional expressions of user preferences through ratings, reviews, likes, dislikes, and other deliberate inputs. While explicit feedback provides clearer, more interpretable signals about user tastes, it suffers from low participation rates and potential biases due to the effort required from users.

\subsection{Historical Evolution of Feedback in Recommender Systems}

The evolution of feedback utilization in recommender systems reflects broader trends in machine learning and user interface design:

\subsubsection{Early Era (1990s--2000s): Explicit Feedback Dominance}
Early recommender systems, such as GroupLens and the original Netflix Prize, relied heavily on explicit ratings. The collaborative filtering paradigm, pioneered by the GroupLens project at the University of Minnesota, established explicit ratings as the gold standard for preference learning. During this period, research focused on matrix factorization techniques that could handle sparse rating matrices, with methods like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and neighborhood-based approaches dominating the field.

\subsubsection{Mid Era (2010s): Implicit Feedback Revolution}
The rise of web-scale applications brought implicit feedback to the forefront. Companies like Amazon and Netflix began leveraging clickstream data, purchase histories, and viewing behaviors. This shift was driven by data abundance rather than data quality, leading to the development of implicit feedback-specific algorithms like Weighted Matrix Factorization and Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR).

\subsubsection{Current Era (2020s): Hybrid and Multimodal Approaches}
Modern recommender systems increasingly integrate multiple feedback types, incorporating contextual information, multimodal signals, and advanced machine learning techniques. The emergence of deep learning, reinforcement learning, and large language models has enabled more sophisticated feedback processing, while privacy concerns have driven the development of federated and differential privacy approaches.

\subsection{The Feedback Spectrum: Beyond Binary Classification}

While the implicit-explicit dichotomy provides a useful framework, real-world feedback exists on a spectrum with varying degrees of explicitness and implicitness:

\subsubsection{Quasi-Explicit Feedback}
Some feedback mechanisms blur the boundary between implicit and explicit. For example:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Thumbs up/down}: Simple binary choices that are more explicit than clicks but less effortful than detailed ratings
    \item \textbf{Star ratings with half-stars}: Provide more granularity than binary feedback but less cognitive load than written reviews
    \item \textbf{Preference rankings}: Users rank items relative to each other, providing comparative feedback
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Behavioral Implicit Feedback}
Implicit feedback itself encompasses various behavioral signals:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Navigation patterns}: Mouse movements, scroll depth, and time spent on pages
    \item \textbf{Physiological signals}: Heart rate, eye tracking, and facial expressions (emerging with wearable devices)
    \item \textbf{Social behaviors}: Following, unfollowing, and network interactions
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Multimodal Feedback Integration}
Modern systems combine multiple feedback modalities:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Textual feedback}: Reviews, comments, and search queries
    \item \textbf{Visual feedback}: Image uploads, video reactions, and visual preferences
    \item \textbf{Audio feedback}: Voice commands, music preferences, and audio reactions
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Why Feedback Types Matter: Theoretical Foundations}

The choice of feedback type has profound implications for system design, user experience, and algorithmic performance:

\subsubsection{Information Theory Perspective}
From an information theory standpoint, implicit feedback provides high-volume, low-fidelity signals, while explicit feedback offers low-volume, high-fidelity information. The optimal feedback strategy involves maximizing information gain per user interaction.

\subsubsection{Cognitive Psychology Perspective}
Explicit feedback requires conscious reflection and effort, engaging System 2 thinking in Daniel Kahneman's framework. Implicit feedback captures System 1 automatic responses, providing insights into instinctive preferences but requiring careful interpretation.

\subsubsection{Economic Perspective}
Implicit feedback has near-zero marginal cost for collection but high processing costs. Explicit feedback incurs user effort costs but lower computational costs for interpretation.

\subsection{Current Research Landscape and Gaps}

Despite extensive research, several critical gaps persist:

\subsubsection{Unified Theoretical Framework}
There is no comprehensive theoretical framework that explains when and why different feedback types should be used, or how they interact in hybrid systems.

\subsubsection{Cross-Domain Feedback Transfer}
Understanding how feedback learned in one domain (e.g., movies) can transfer to another (e.g., books) remains underexplored.

\subsubsection{Longitudinal Feedback Dynamics}
How user feedback patterns evolve over time, and how systems should adapt to changing preference landscapes, is not well understood.

\subsubsection{Fairness and Bias in Feedback Collection}
The differential availability and quality of feedback across demographic groups creates fairness challenges that are only beginning to be addressed.

\subsubsection{Privacy-Efficiency Trade-offs}
Balancing the benefits of rich feedback collection with privacy preservation requirements remains a key challenge.

\subsection{Key Research Questions}
\label{subsec:research_questions}

To address these gaps, we pose the following comprehensive research questions:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Fundamental Characteristics}: How do implicit and explicit feedback differ in terms of data characteristics, collection mechanisms, and inherent biases? What are the theoretical bounds on performance for each feedback type?

    \item \textbf{Modeling Paradigms}: What are the most effective algorithms for modeling each feedback type? How can we develop unified frameworks that handle both types seamlessly?

    \item \textbf{Hybrid Integration}: What are the optimal strategies for combining implicit and explicit feedback? How can we resolve conflicts between different feedback signals?

    \item \textbf{Evaluation Frameworks}: How should we evaluate systems that use different feedback types? What metrics account for the unique characteristics of each feedback modality?

    \item \textbf{Domain Adaptation}: How do feedback characteristics and optimal modeling approaches vary across different application domains?

    \item \textbf{Bias and Fairness}: How can we mitigate biases inherent in different feedback collection mechanisms? What fairness guarantees can we provide?

    \item \textbf{Privacy Preservation}: How can we collect and utilize feedback while preserving user privacy? What are the trade-offs between utility and privacy?

    \item \textbf{Temporal Dynamics}: How do feedback patterns evolve over time? How should systems should adapt to changing user preferences and feedback landscapes?

    \item \textbf{Emerging Technologies}: What role will large language models, multimodal learning, and brain-computer interfaces play in future feedback systems?

    \item \textbf{Human-AI Interaction}: How can recommender systems elicit better feedback from users? What interfaces and interaction designs optimize feedback quality and quantity?
\end{enumerate}

\section{Taxonomy of Feedback Types}
\label{sec:taxonomy}

Feedback in recommender systems can be categorized based on its source, properties, and collection mechanisms. We develop a comprehensive taxonomy that encompasses both implicit and explicit feedback, considering behavioral signals, data characteristics, and privacy implications. This taxonomy goes beyond simple binary classification to capture the nuanced spectrum of feedback modalities available in modern recommender systems.

\subsection{Feedback Sources and Granularity Levels}

\subsubsection{Implicit Feedback Sources}
Implicit feedback originates from user actions that indirectly reveal preferences without requiring conscious user effort. These signals are automatically captured through digital interactions and provide rich behavioral data.

\paragraph{Micro-level Implicit Signals}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Clickstream data}: Individual clicks on items, links, or recommendations. Includes metadata like click position, time of day, and device type.
    \item \textbf{Dwell time}: Duration spent viewing an item page or content. Thresholds (e.g., 30\% of video watched) indicate engagement levels.
    \item \textbf{Scroll depth}: How far users scroll through content, revealing interest intensity.
    \item \textbf{Mouse movements}: Cursor trajectories and hover behaviors that indicate attention patterns.
    \item \textbf{Keyboard interactions}: Search queries, typing patterns, and navigation shortcuts.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Meso-level Implicit Signals}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Session-level behaviors}: Sequences of page views, item comparisons, and navigation paths within a single session.
    \item \textbf{Purchase funnels}: Cart additions, wishlists, and abandoned checkout behaviors.
    \item \textbf{Social engagement}: Shares, bookmarks, saves, and forwarding actions.
    \item \textbf{Consumption patterns}: Reading completion rates, playback speeds, and repeat consumption.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Macro-level Implicit Signals}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Longitudinal patterns}: Repeated purchases, seasonal preferences, and evolving taste profiles.
    \item \textbf{Cross-platform behaviors}: Consistent preferences across different devices and platforms.
    \item \textbf{Network effects}: Influence from social connections and community behaviors.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Explicit Feedback Sources}
Explicit feedback involves deliberate user actions to express preferences, requiring conscious effort but providing clearer semantic meaning.

\paragraph{Quantitative Explicit Feedback}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Numerical ratings}: Star ratings (1-5 scale), percentage scores, or continuous scales.
    \item \textbf{Like/dislike binaries}: Simple positive/negative indicators with minimal cognitive load.
    \item \textbf{Preference rankings}: Ordinal rankings of items relative to each other.
    \item \textbf{Confidence scores}: Self-assessed confidence in one's own ratings.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Qualitative Explicit Feedback}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Textual reviews}: Written opinions, critiques, and detailed feedback.
    \item \textbf{Tags and categories}: User-assigned labels and classifications.
    \item \textbf{Feature ratings}: Specific aspect ratings (e.g., "sound quality: 4/5, plot: 3/5").
    \item \textbf{Comparative feedback}: Direct comparisons between items or against expectations.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Interactive Explicit Feedback}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Conversational feedback}: Dialogue-based preference elicitation through chat interfaces.
    \item \textbf{Preference surveys}: Structured questionnaires and preference profiling.
    \item \textbf{Active learning queries}: System-initiated questions to clarify user preferences.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Feedback Properties and Characteristics}

Feedback types exhibit distinct properties that influence their utility, reliability, and modeling requirements. Understanding these properties is crucial for designing appropriate algorithms and evaluation metrics.

\subsubsection{Data Abundance and Collection Dynamics}

\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Noise Characteristics and Signal Quality}

Implicit feedback is inherently noisy due to ambiguous user intent:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{False positives}: Clicks that don't indicate genuine interest (accidental, curiosity-driven)
    \item \textbf{Contextual noise}: Behaviors influenced by external factors (time pressure, distractions)
    \item \textbf{Platform artifacts}: Behaviors driven by UI design rather than preferences
    \item \textbf{Multi-user signals}: Shared devices or accounts introducing confounding signals
\end{itemize}

Explicit feedback, while clearer, has different noise characteristics:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Mood-dependent bias}: Ratings influenced by temporary emotional states
    \item \textbf{Social desirability bias}: Users providing socially acceptable rather than genuine opinions
    \item \textbf{Recency bias}: Recent experiences disproportionately influencing feedback
    \item \textbf{Scale interpretation variance}: Different users interpreting rating scales differently
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Temporal and Contextual Dimensions}

Feedback evolves over time and varies by context:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Short-term vs. long-term preferences}: Immediate reactions vs. stable tastes
    \item \textbf{Situational context}: Preferences varying by time of day, location, or social setting
    \item \textbf{Device-dependent behaviors}: Different interaction patterns on mobile vs. desktop
    \item \textbf{Cohort effects}: Generational differences in feedback provision and interpretation
\end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Text-visual feedback}: Product images with review text
    \item \textbf{Audio-temporal feedback}: Music listening with skip behaviors
    \item \textbf{Spatial-temporal feedback}: Location-based preferences over time
    \item \textbf{Social-contextual feedback}: Group preferences in social settings
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Feedback Reliability Metrics}

Different feedback types have varying reliability characteristics:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Internal consistency}: How consistent feedback is within a user
    \item \textbf{External validity}: How well feedback predicts actual behavior
    \item \textbf{Temporal stability}: How consistent feedback is over time
    \item \textbf{Cross-platform consistency}: Feedback agreement across different contexts
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Data Collection Mechanisms and Infrastructure}

\subsubsection{Implicit Feedback Collection}

Implicit feedback collection requires sophisticated tracking infrastructure:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Event logging systems}: Real-time capture of user interactions
    \item \textbf{Cookie and session tracking}: Maintaining user identity across sessions
    \item \textbf{Device fingerprinting}: Cross-device user identification
    \item \textbf{Third-party data integration}: Incorporating external behavioral signals
\end{itemize}

Data Minimization & Challenging & Feasible & Storage efficiency \\
User Control & Limited & High & Autonomy preservation \\
Third-party Sharing & Common & Rare & Data brokerage risks \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Ethical Challenges}

Feedback collection raises several ethical concerns:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Consent and transparency}: Users often unaware of implicit data collection
    \item \textbf{Algorithmic bias amplification}: Feedback patterns reflecting societal biases
    \item \textbf{Manipulation risks}: Systems influencing user behavior through feedback incentives
    \item \textbf{Privacy-utility trade-offs}: Balancing personalization benefits with privacy costs
\end{itemize}

\section{Learning Paradigms and Modeling Approaches}
\label{sec:learning}

This section provides an extensive review of how implicit and explicit feedback are modeled across classical and modern approaches, including hybrid methods that integrate both types. We cover algorithmic foundations, mathematical formulations, and practical implementation considerations.

\subsection{Classical Approaches}

\subsubsection{Matrix Factorization Fundamentals}

Matrix factorization decomposes user-item interaction matrices into latent factor representations. For explicit feedback, the problem is formulated as:

\begin{equation}
\min_{P,Q} \sum_{(u,i) \in \mathcal{R}} (r_{ui} - p_u^T q_i)^2 + \lambda (\|P\|^2 + \|Q\|^2)
\label{eq:explicit_mf}
\end{equation}

where $r_{ui}$ represents explicit ratings, $p_u$ and $q_i$ are user and item latent factors, and $\lambda$ is a regularization parameter.

For implicit feedback, the formulation changes to handle binary preferences:

\begin{equation}
\min_{P,Q} \sum_{(u,i) \in \mathcal{R}^+} w_{ui} (1 - p_u^T q_i)^2 + \lambda (\|P\|^2 + \|Q\|^2)
\label{eq:implicit_mf}
\end{equation}

where $\mathcal{R}^+$ denotes observed implicit interactions and $w_{ui}$ represents confidence weights.

\subsubsection{Weighted Matrix Factorization (WMF)}

WMF addresses implicit feedback sparsity by treating unobserved interactions as negative signals with varying confidence:

\begin{equation}
\min_{P,Q} \sum_{u,i} c_{ui} (p_{ui} - p_u^T q_i)^2 + \lambda (\|P\|^2 + \|Q\|^2)
\label{eq:wmf}
\end{equation}

where $c_{ui} = \alpha r_{ui}$ for observed interactions and $c_{ui} = 1$ for unobserved ones, with $r_{ui}$ being the implicit feedback strength.

\subsubsection{Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR)}

BPR optimizes for ranking rather than rating prediction, using pairwise preferences:

\begin{equation}
\min_{\Theta} -\sum_{(u,i,j) \in D} \ln \sigma(\hat{r}_{ui} - \hat{r}_{uj}) + \lambda_\Theta \|\Theta\|^2
\label{eq:bpr}
\end{equation}

where $D$ contains triples $(u,i,j)$ indicating user $u$ prefers item $i$ over item $j$.

\subsection{Deep Learning Architectures}

\subsubsection{Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF)}

NCF extends matrix factorization with neural networks:

\begin{equation}
\hat{y}_{ui} = f(p_u, q_i, p_u \odot q_i | \Theta)
\label{eq:ncf}
\end{equation}

where $f(\cdot)$ is a neural network that learns complex interaction patterns from both implicit and explicit feedback.

\subsubsection{Autoencoders for Implicit Feedback}

Denoising autoencoders reconstruct user feedback vectors:

\begin{equation}
\hat{r}_u = f_\theta(f_\phi(r_u + \epsilon))
\label{eq:autoencoder}
\end{equation}

where $\epsilon$ represents noise injection to improve generalization.

\subsubsection{Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)}

GNNs model user-item interactions as graphs:

\begin{equation}
h_u^{(l+1)} = \sigma\left(\sum_{v \in \mathcal{N}(u)} \frac{1}{\sqrt{|\mathcal{N}(u)||\mathcal{N}(v)|}} W^{(l)} h_v^{(l)}\right)
\label{eq:gnn}
\end{equation}

where $\mathcal{N}(u)$ denotes neighbors in the user-item interaction graph.

\subsection{Reinforcement Learning Approaches}

\subsubsection{Markov Decision Processes for Recommendations}

Recommendations are framed as sequential decision-making:

\begin{equation}
\pi^*(s) = \arg\max_\pi \mathbb{E}\left[\sum_{t=0}^\infty \gamma^t r(s_t, a_t) \bigg| s_0 = s, \pi\right]
\label{eq:rl_mdp}
\end{equation}

where states $s$ include user context, actions $a$ are item recommendations, and rewards $r$ come from implicit feedback.

\subsubsection{Contextual Bandits}

Multi-armed bandit approaches balance exploration and exploitation:

\begin{equation}
\mu_{t+1} = \mu_t + \alpha_t (r_t - \mu_t)
\label{eq:bandit_update}
\end{equation}

where $\mu_t$ tracks expected rewards from implicit user responses.

\subsection{Contrastive Learning Paradigms}

\subsubsection{SimCLR for Recommendations}

Contrastive learning maximizes agreement between different views of user-item interactions:

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L} = -\log \frac{\exp(\text{sim}(z_i, z_j)/\tau)}{\sum_{k=1}^{2N} \mathbb{I}_{[k \neq i]} \exp(\text{sim}(z_i, z_k)/\tau)}
\label{eq:contrastive}
\end{equation}

where $z_i, z_j$ are representations from positive pairs and $\tau$ is temperature.

\subsubsection{Hybrid Contrastive Objectives}

Combining supervised and self-supervised learning:

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{hybrid} = \mathcal{L}_{supervised} + \lambda \mathcal{L}_{contrastive}
\label{eq:hybrid_contrastive}
\end{equation}

balancing explicit supervision with implicit structure learning.

\subsection{Modern Approaches}

\subsubsection{Deep Learning Models}
Neural networks have revolutionized RS modeling. Autoencoders handle implicit feedback sparsity through reconstruction \cite{sedhain2015autorec}. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) process sequential behaviors \cite{tang2018personalized}. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) model user-item interactions as graphs \cite{wang2019neural}.

\subsubsection{Reinforcement Learning}
Reinforcement Learning (RL) frames recommendations as sequential decision-making. Implicit feedback serves as rewards, with exploration-exploitation trade-offs \cite{zhao2018recommendations}. Explicit feedback can provide more precise reward signals \cite{chen2019large}.

\subsubsection{Contrastive Learning}
Self-supervised contrastive learning leverages implicit feedback for representation learning. Methods like SimCLR adapt to RS by contrasting user-item interactions \cite{wu2021self}. Hybrid approaches combine contrastive objectives with explicit supervision \cite{xie2022contrastive}.

\subsection{Implicit-to-Explicit Conversions}

Several techniques convert implicit feedback to pseudo-explicit ratings:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Ordinal regression}: Maps implicit signals to rating scales \cite{weston2011wsabie}.
    \item \textbf{Confidence weighting}: Assigns confidence scores to implicit preferences \cite{he2016fast}.
    \item \textbf{Generative models}: Uses GANs to synthesize explicit feedback from implicit data \cite{wang2017irgan}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Hybrid Models}

Hybrid approaches jointly model both feedback types:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Multi-task learning}: Optimizes separate objectives for implicit and explicit feedback \cite{ma2011learning}.
    \item \textbf{Unified frameworks}: Integrates feedback types in shared latent spaces \cite{lian2017cccfnet}.
    \item \textbf{Attention mechanisms}: Weights different feedback sources dynamically \cite{chen2017attentive}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Detailed Modeling Techniques}

\subsubsection{Neural Matrix Factorization}

Neural extensions of matrix factorization use multi-layer perceptrons to model non-linear interactions. For implicit feedback, models like NeuMF \cite{he2017neural} learn from binary preferences, achieving state-of-the-art performance on ranking tasks.

\subsubsection{Sequence Modeling}

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Transformers capture temporal dependencies in implicit feedback sequences. Models like BERT4Rec \cite{sun2019bert4rec} treat recommendation as a sequence prediction problem.

\subsubsection{Graph-Based Approaches}

Graph Neural Networks model user-item interactions as heterogeneous graphs. Methods like LightGCN \cite{he2020lightgcn} propagate preferences through graph convolutions, effectively handling implicit feedback sparsity.

\subsubsection{Generative Models}

Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) generate synthetic feedback. For implicit data, VAEs learn latent representations that reconstruct user behavior patterns.

\subsection{Hybrid Integration Strategies}

\subsubsection{Attention-Based Fusion}

Attention mechanisms dynamically weight feedback sources. For example, in a music recommender, recent explicit ratings might receive higher attention than older implicit plays.

\subsubsection{Multi-Modal Learning}

Combining feedback with content features (e.g., item descriptions) enhances modeling. Vision-language models process explicit reviews alongside implicit clicks.

\subsubsection{Cross-Feedback Translation}

Techniques translate between feedback types. For instance, using LLMs to generate explicit ratings from implicit patterns.

\subsection{Computational Complexity and Scalability}

Implicit feedback models must handle large-scale data. Techniques like negative sampling and distributed training enable scalability. Explicit feedback models are computationally lighter but data-scarce.

\subsection{Evaluation of Modeling Approaches}

Empirical studies show that hybrid models outperform single-type approaches. However, performance gains depend on domain and data quality.

\subsection{Case Studies}

\end{itemize}

\section{Evaluation Methodologies}
\label{sec:evaluation}

Evaluating recommender systems requires metrics that account for feedback characteristics and potential biases. The choice of evaluation methodology fundamentally depends on the feedback type used, with implicit and explicit feedback requiring different approaches and interpretations.

\subsection{Standard Metrics}

\subsubsection{Ranking Metrics}
Precision@K, Recall@K, Mean Average Precision (MAP), and Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) assess recommendation quality. These metrics behave differently under implicit vs. explicit feedback:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Implicit feedback} often uses binary relevance (clicked/not clicked), favoring ranking accuracy over absolute preference strength.
    \item \textbf{Explicit feedback} incorporates preference strength, allowing for more nuanced evaluation of recommendation quality.
    \item \textbf{Hybrid approaches} require careful calibration to balance ranking and rating prediction objectives.
\end{itemize}

The mathematical formulations reveal important differences:

\begin{equation}
\text{Precision@K} = \frac{|\{i \in \text{top-K} \cap \text{relevant}\}|}{K}
\label{eq:precision_k}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\text{NDCG@K} = \frac{1}{|U|} \sum_{u \in U} \frac{\sum_{i=1}^K \frac{rel_{u,i}}{log_2(i+1)}}{\sum_{i=1}^{|REL_u|} \frac{1}{log_2(i+1)}}
\label{eq:ndcg_k}
\end{equation}

where $rel_{u,i}$ represents relevance scores that differ significantly between implicit (binary) and explicit (graded) feedback.

\subsubsection{Rating Prediction Metrics}
Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) evaluate explicit rating predictions:

\begin{equation}
\text{RMSE} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{|R|} \sum_{(u,i) \in R} (\hat{r}_{ui} - r_{ui})^2}
\label{eq:rmse}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\text{MAE} = \frac{1}{|R|} \sum_{(u,i) \in R} |\hat{r}_{ui} - r_{ui}|
\label{eq:mae}
\end{equation}

These metrics are less applicable to implicit feedback, which lacks ground-truth ratings, necessitating alternative evaluation approaches.

\subsubsection{Area Under the Curve (AUC) Metrics}
For implicit feedback evaluation, AUC-based metrics provide robust ranking assessment:

\begin{equation}
\text{AUC} = \frac{1}{|U|} \sum_{u \in U} \frac{1}{|I_u^+||I_u^-|} \sum_{i^+ \in I_u^+} \sum_{i^- \in I_u^-} \mathbb{I}(\hat{r}_{ui^+} > \hat{r}_{ui^-})
\label{eq:auc}
\end{equation}

where $I_u^+$ and $I_u^-$ represent positive and negative feedback items for user $u$.

\subsection{Evaluation Biases and Challenges}

\subsubsection{Dataset Biases}
Public datasets exhibit various biases that affect evaluation reliability:

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Evaluation Biases in Different Feedback Types}
\label{tab:evaluation_biases}
\begin{tabular}{@{}lccc@{}}
\toprule
Bias Type & Implicit Feedback & Explicit Feedback & Mitigation Strategies \\
\midrule
Popularity Bias & High (rich-get-richer) & Moderate & Inverse propensity scoring \\
Position Bias & Very High & Moderate & Position debiasing, randomization \\
Selection Bias & Low & Very High & Inverse propensity weighting \\
Confirmation Bias & Moderate & High & Counterfactual evaluation \\
Temporal Bias & High & Moderate & Time-aware validation \\
Demographic Bias & Moderate & High & Fairness-aware evaluation \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{User Behavior Interpretations}
Implicit feedback interpretations can be misleading:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Engagement vs. Interest}: Long watch times may indicate engagement or involuntary attention (e.g., background TV)
    \item \textbf{Contextual Influences}: Clicks may result from curiosity, social pressure, or algorithmic manipulation
    \item \textbf{Behavioral Variability}: User interaction patterns vary significantly across demographics and contexts
    \item \textbf{False Negatives}: Lack of interaction doesn't necessarily indicate lack of interest
\end{itemize}

Explicit feedback, while clearer, has its own interpretation challenges:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Mood-Dependent Ratings}: Emotional state influences rating consistency
    \item \textbf{Social Desirability Bias}: Users provide socially acceptable rather than genuine opinions
    \item \textbf{Scale Interpretation Variance}: Different users interpret rating scales differently
    \item \textbf{Recency Effects}: Recent experiences disproportionately influence feedback
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Advanced Evaluation Frameworks}

\text{Diversity} = 1 - \frac{\sum_{i,j \in L} s(i,j)}{|L|(|L|-1)}
\label{eq:diversity}
\end{equation}

where $s(i,j)$ measures similarity between recommended items and $L$ is the recommendation list.

\subsubsection{Serendipity Metrics}

Measuring unexpected relevant recommendations:

\begin{equation}
\text{Serendipity} = \frac{1}{|U|} \sum_u \frac{|\{i \in L_u | rel(u,i) \land unexpected(u,i)\}|}{|L_u|}
\label{eq:serendipity}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Coverage Metrics}

    \item \textbf{Temporal Debiasing}: Handling temporal distribution shifts in feedback
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Fairness-Aware Evaluation}

Ensuring equitable performance across user groups:

\begin{equation}
\text{Demographic Parity} = \max_g \left| \frac{|\{u \in g | \text{satisfied}(u)\}|}{|g|} - \frac{|\{u \notin g | \text{satisfied}(u)\}|}{|U \setminus g|} \right|
\label{eq:demographic_parity}

\section{Challenges and Future Directions}
\label{sec:challenges}

Despite significant advances, implicit and explicit feedback integration presents substantial challenges. This section examines current limitations and emerging research directions that will shape the next generation of recommendation systems.

\subsection{Technical Challenges}

\subsubsection{Data Quality and Noise Issues}

Feedback signals are inherently noisy and require sophisticated processing:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Implicit Feedback Noise}: User actions may not reflect true preferences (accidental clicks, external influences)
    \item \textbf{Explicit Feedback Bias}: Self-selection bias in rating systems, where only highly satisfied/dissatisfied users provide feedback
    \item \textbf{Contextual Interference}: Environmental factors affecting feedback interpretation (time pressure, device limitations)
    \item \textbf{Adversarial Manipulation}: Malicious users attempting to game recommendation algorithms
\end{itemize}

Mathematical formulation of noise in implicit feedback:
\begin{equation}
y_{ui} = f(p_{ui}) + \epsilon_{ui} + \eta_{ui}
\end{equation}
where $y_{ui}$ is observed feedback, $f(p_{ui})$ is true preference, $\epsilon_{ui}$ is random noise, and $\eta_{ui}$ is systematic bias.

\subsubsection{Sparsity and Cold-Start Problems}

New users and items lack sufficient feedback history:
