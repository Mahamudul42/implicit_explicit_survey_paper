## 📋 Abstract

This survey provides the first comprehensive analysis comparing implicit and explicit feedback mechanisms in recommender systems, establishing a unified theoretical framework and systematic evaluation methodology. Through systematic analysis of 147 research papers spanning 2010-2025, we identify key algorithmic paradigms, evaluation challenges, and emerging research directions.

**Key Contributions:**
1. Five-dimensional unified taxonomy for feedback characterization
2. Systematic analysis of 147 papers across algorithmic approaches
3. Bias-aware evaluation framework with 27 metrics
4. Meta-analysis of performance improvements across feedback types
5. Domain-specific insights across 6 major application areas
6. Practitioner decision framework and implementation guidelines
7. Comprehensive reproducibility resources and dataset characterization

## 📚 Key Concepts

### Five-Dimensional Feedback Taxonomy:
1. **Collection Mechanism:** Passive ↔ Active
2. **Signal Quality:** Low SNR ↔ High SNR
3. **Temporal Characteristics:** Real-time ↔ Delayed
4. **Cognitive Load:** Zero effort ↔ High effort
5. **Privacy Sensitivity:** Public ↔ Highly sensitive

### Core Insights:
- **Complementarity Principle:** Implicit and explicit feedback are complementary, not competing
- **Bias-Performance Trade-off:** Different feedback types exhibit distinct bias patterns
- **Temporal Advantage:** Implicit feedback enables superior adaptation
- **Domain Dependency:** Optimal strategies are highly domain-dependent

### Hybrid Superiority:
- 15-32% improvement over single-feedback approaches
- Attention-based fusion achieves highest gains (+24.3%)
- Modern architectures (LLMs, transformers) show +26-31% improvements
